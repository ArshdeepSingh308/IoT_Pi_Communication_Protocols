# IoT_Pi_Communication_Protocols
In this project, two Raspberry Pi's are programmed to communicate with each other over different protocols according to the different time of the day.

IoT (Internet of Things) is basically a network of devices communicating with each other.

In this project two communication protocols have been used.
1. RFCOMM
2. MQTT

According to the time of the day, the two Raspberry Pi’s communicate with each other using different protocols.
During the day time, the Pi’s communicate over Wi-Fi and at the night time they communicate using the Bluetooth. 
We have also used InsightOps by Rapid 7 for collecting and visualizing the live data.
